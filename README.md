# Experiences and notes during my programming career
## React
- Always set default value for state parameter of a reducer, otherwise, the state type will be "never" in app state (generated according to rootReducer)
## NodeJS
- Use [express-generator-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-typescript) to generate a basic NodeJS template with TypeScript.
- Use [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) to manipulate arrays and collections
## Testing
- [How to Write Unit Tests for Asynchronous Redux Thunk](https://decembersoft.com/posts/how-to-unit-test-redux-thunks/)
- Use `useEvent` instead of `fireEvent`. Install `useEvent` [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/).
