# Experiences and notes during my programming career
## React
- Always set default value for state parameter of a reducer, otherwise, the state type will be "never" in app state (generated according to rootReducer)
## NodeJS
- Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-typescript to generate a basic NodeJS template with TypeScript.
